# Space-Mission-Analysis
Space mission data analysis using Python and data visualization techniques.

🚀 Space Mission Analysis
This project was completed as part of my internship training at Imarticus Learning, where I worked with a global space-missions dataset containing 4300+ records.
The goal of the project was to perform end-to-end data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and extract insights about space agencies, mission outcomes, launch trends, and rocket performance.
This project helped me understand how real-world datasets are analysed using Python and visualization libraries.

⭐ Project Overview
The dataset includes several decades of global space launches with fields such as:

Organisation

Location

Date

Rocket details

Mission status

Mission outcome

Price

Rocket type

Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and statistical tests, I explored multiple real-world insights.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
✔ Loaded dataset with 4324 rows & 9 columns
✔ Removed unnecessary “Unnamed” columns
✔ Filled missing values (Price → median)
✔ Converted Date column to proper datetime
✔ Removed unrealistic outliers
✔ Final dataset contains:
Organisation, Location, Date, Detail, Rocket_Status, Price

The cleaned dataset was used for all further analysis.


SPACE MISSION
📊 Key Questions & Insights
1. Missions Over Time

Bar plot showing growth, decline, and historic cycles

Peaks represent the space race and rise of private companies

2. Top 10 Space Organisations

NASA, Roscosmos, and SpaceX dominate

Shift from government to private players

3. Mission Success vs Failure

Pie chart showing mission reliability

Helps understand risks in early-stage launches

4. Outlier Detection (Missions per Year)

Identifies unusually high/low mission years

5. Normality Check

Histogram & Q-Q plot show mission count is not normally distributed

6. Missions by Rocket Type

Shows which rockets are most frequently used

7. Success Rate by Organisation

Compares performance & reliability

8. Failure Causes

Technical issues, vehicle malfunctions, test-phase failures

9. ISRO Launch Trend

Scatter/bubble plot visualizing ISRO’s mission growth over years

10. Rocket Status Analysis

Active vs retired rockets usage trend

11. Busiest Launch Months

Seasonal patterns in space agencies’ launch schedules

12. Top 10 Launch Sites

Baikonur, Cape Canaveral, and top commercial sites analyzed
